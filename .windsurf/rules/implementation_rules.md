#Implementation/Modification Rules:


For when doing any kind of implementation or modification follow the below guidelines : 

Guidelines:

1. Output the summary of the understanding of the task in short.
2. Analyse the code base thoroughly by referring (.windsurf/CodeMap.md) to check which files and code segements needs to be updated.
3. Refer to (.windsurf/design_system.md) and check for existing reusable components to avoid redundancy before creating new elements.
4. Identify Changes that needs to be done. 
5. Check for similar places that require updation with the change proposed.
6. Consider updating the code segments you found, that needs to be updated with the changes implemented.
7. Always use SOLID principles.
8. Always keep Models, Scripts, Helpers, Core Business Logic and UI separately either during any implementation or any updation. 


PREVENTIONS: 
- Avoid refactoring unrelated code.
- Avoid modifying existing code when its outside the scope.
- Updating the (.windsurf/CodeMap.md) after the changes
- Update (.windsurf/Task.md) by marking off the completed module/task.


DELIVERABLES:
- Summary of the task and changes done.
- All Cases and places where the code is updated accordingly.
- Next Steps if any to be done or check.
