1. Investigate issue 1: cursor jump when switching assignee type in Create Task. Review create_task_screen and focus handling.
2. Investigate issue 2: calendar events not updating after first connect. Check Flutter calendar integration & backend token refresh handling; identify needed client-side changes.
3. Implement fixes for issue 1 and issue 2 (frontend and any necessary client config), update CodeMap/Task docs, and validate behavior.
